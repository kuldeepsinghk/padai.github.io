[{"category":"Fractions","question":"What is the sum of 1/4 and 2/5?","options":["3/9","3/20","13/20","3/10"],"correct":2,"rationale":"To add fractions, you need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 5 is 20. Convert 1/4 to 5/20 and 2/5 to 8/20. Then, add the numerators: 5/20 + 8/20 = 13/20."},{"category":"Fractions","question":"Which of the following fractions is equivalent to 3/4?","options":["6/12","9/16","12/16","15/30"],"correct":2,"rationale":"To find an equivalent fraction, multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number. Multiplying both the numerator and denominator of 3/4 by 4 gives 12/16. 6/12 simplifies to 1/2, 9/16 is not equivalent, and 15/30 simplifies to 1/2."},{"category":"Algebra","question":"What is the value of 'x' in the equation x + 5 = 12?","options":["5","7","17","60"],"correct":1,"rationale":"To find the value of 'x', you need to isolate 'x' by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5, which simplifies to x = 7."},{"category":"Algebra","question":"Which of the following expressions represents '3 times a number plus 4'?","options":["3 + x + 4","3x + 4","3(x + 4)","3 + 4x"],"correct":1,"rationale":"'3 times a number' can be represented as 3x, where 'x' is the number. 'Plus 4' means we add 4 to that result, so the correct expression is 3x + 4."},{"category":"Whole Numbers","question":"What is the value of the expression 12 + (18 รท 3) - 5?","options":["13","21","29","19"],"correct":1,"rationale":"Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), first divide 18 by 3, which equals 6. Then add 12 to 6, which equals 18. Finally, subtract 5 from 18, which equals 13."},{"category":"Whole Numbers","question":"Which of the following numbers is both a multiple of 6 and a factor of 36?","options":["4","8","12","15"],"correct":2,"rationale":"A multiple of 6 is a number that can be divided by 6 without a remainder. A factor of 36 is a number that divides evenly into 36. 12 is divisible by 6 (12 รท 6 = 2) and divides evenly into 36 (36 รท 12 = 3)."},{"category":"Integers","question":"What is the opposite of -7?","options":["-7","0","7","-1/7"],"correct":2,"rationale":"The opposite of a number is the number with the opposite sign. The opposite of -7 is 7."},{"category":"Integers","question":"Which of the following integers is the greatest?","options":["-5","0","-12","3"],"correct":3,"rationale":"Positive integers are always greater than negative integers and zero. 3 is the only positive integer in the list, therefore it is the greatest."}]
