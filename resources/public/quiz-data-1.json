[{"category":"Fractions","question":"What is the simplified form of the fraction 12/18?","options":["6/9","4/6","2/3","1/2"],"correct":2,"rationale":"To simplify a fraction, you divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF). The GCF of 12 and 18 is 6. Dividing both by 6, you get 12/6 = 2 and 18/6 = 3. Therefore, the simplified form is 2/3."},{"category":"Fractions","question":"Which of the following fractions is equivalent to 3/5?","options":["6/15","9/10","12/20","15/30"],"correct":2,"rationale":"Equivalent fractions are fractions that represent the same value, even though they have different numerators and denominators. To find an equivalent fraction, you can multiply (or divide) both the numerator and the denominator by the same number. In this case, multiplying both the numerator (3) and the denominator (5) of 3/5 by 4 gives you 12/20."},{"category":"Algebra","question":"What is the value of x in the equation x + 5 = 12?","options":["5","7","17","60"],"correct":1,"rationale":"To find the value of x, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5.  This simplifies to x = 7."},{"category":"Algebra","question":"Which expression represents 'three times a number plus four', if the number is represented by 'y'?","options":["3 + y + 4","3y + 4","3 + 4y","3(y + 4)"],"correct":1,"rationale":"'Three times a number' means 3 multiplied by y, or 3y.  'Plus four' means we add 4 to that, resulting in the expression 3y + 4."},{"category":"Whole Numbers","question":"What is the prime factorization of 72?","options":["2 x 3 x 12","2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3","2 x 6 x 6","8 x 9"],"correct":1,"rationale":"Prime factorization means breaking down a number into its prime factors. 72 can be broken down as 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3, where 2 and 3 are prime numbers."},{"category":"Whole Numbers","question":"Which of the following numbers is divisible by both 3 and 5?","options":["16","25","30","32"],"correct":2,"rationale":"A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5. Only 30 meets both criteria (3 + 0 = 3, and it ends in 0)."},{"category":"Integers","question":"Which of the following numbers is the furthest from 0 on the number line?","options":["-5","3","-2","1"],"correct":0,"rationale":"The distance from 0 on the number line is the absolute value of the number. The absolute value of -5 is 5, which is greater than the absolute values of 3, -2, and 1."},{"category":"Integers","question":"What is -8 + 3?","options":["-11","11","-5","5"],"correct":2,"rationale":"When adding integers with different signs, find the difference between their absolute values and take the sign of the integer with the larger absolute value. The difference between 8 and 3 is 5. Since 8 has a larger absolute value and is negative, the answer is -5."}]
