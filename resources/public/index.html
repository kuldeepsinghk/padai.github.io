    const quizData = [{"category":"Fractions","question":"What is the simplified form of the fraction 12/18?","options":["1/3","2/3","3/4","5/6"],"correct":1,"rationale":"Both 12 and 18 are divisible by 6. Dividing both numerator and denominator by 6 gives 2/3."},{"category":"Fractions","question":"What is the result of adding 1/4 and 2/5?","options":["3/9","3/20","13/20","11/20"],"correct":2,"rationale":"To add fractions, they need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 4 and 5 is 20.  1/4 = 5/20 and 2/5 = 8/20. Therefore, 5/20 + 8/20 = 13/20."},{"category":"Fractions","question":"What is the product of 2/3 and 3/4?","options":["5/7","1/2","6/7","5/12"],"correct":1,"rationale":"To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators and the denominators. (2/3) * (3/4) = 6/12. Simplify 6/12 to 1/2."},{"category":"Fractions","question":"What is the value of 2 1/2 divided by 1/4?","options":["5/8","1/8","10","2 1/8"],"correct":2,"rationale":"First convert 2 1/2 to an improper fraction: 5/2. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.  So, (5/2) / (1/4) = (5/2) * (4/1) = 20/2 = 10."},{"category":"Fractions","question":"Which of the following fractions is greater than 1/2?","options":["3/8","4/9","5/12","7/12"],"correct":3,"rationale":"1/2 is equal to 6/12. Comparing the fractions, 3/8 < 1/2, 4/9 < 1/2, 5/12 < 1/2, and 7/12 > 1/2. Therefore, 7/12 is the answer."},{"category":"LCM and HCF","question":"What is the LCM of 6 and 8?","options":["12","24","48","36"],"correct":1,"rationale":"The LCM (Least Common Multiple) is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 6 and 8. Multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30,... and multiples of 8 are 8, 16, 24, 32,... The smallest number they both have in common is 24."},{"category":"LCM and HCF","question":"What is the HCF (Highest Common Factor) of 12 and 18?","options":["3","4","6","9"],"correct":2,"rationale":"The HCF is the largest number that divides both 12 and 18 without leaving a remainder. The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. The largest factor they have in common is 6."},{"category":"LCM and HCF","question":"Which pair of numbers has an LCM of 20?","options":["2 and 5","4 and 5","2 and 10","10 and 20"],"correct":1,"rationale":"The LCM of 4 and 5 is 20. Multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20,... and multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20,... The smallest number they both have in common is 20."},{"category":"LCM and HCF","question":"Find the HCF of 15 and 25.","options":["3","5","10","15"],"correct":1,"rationale":"The HCF is the largest number that divides both 15 and 25. The factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. The factors of 25 are 1, 5, and 25. The largest factor they have in common is 5."},{"category":"LCM and HCF","question":"What is the smallest number that is divisible by both 4 and 9?","options":["13","18","36","72"],"correct":2,"rationale":"The smallest number divisible by both 4 and 9 is their LCM. Multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36,... and multiples of 9 are 9, 18, 27, 36,... The smallest number they both have in common is 36."},{"category":"Whole Numbers","question":"What is the value of (-5) x (-4) x (-2)?","options":["40","-40","-11","11"],"correct":1,"rationale":"The product of two negative numbers is positive. So, (-5) x (-4) = 20. Then, 20 x (-2) = -40."},{"category":"Whole Numbers","question":"Which of the following numbers is a multiple of both 6 and 8?","options":["18","20","24","30"],"correct":2,"rationale":"A multiple of both 6 and 8 must be divisible by both. 18 is divisible by 6 but not 8. 20 is not divisible by 6 or 8. 24 is divisible by both 6 and 8 (6 x 4 = 24, 8 x 3 = 24). 30 is divisible by 6 but not 8."},{"category":"Whole Numbers","question":"What is the greatest common factor (GCF) of 36 and 48?","options":["6","12","24","144"],"correct":1,"rationale":"The factors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.
